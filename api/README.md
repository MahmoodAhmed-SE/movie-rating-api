## Background
This project is made for the purpose of learning and practicing **Go language**, and the backend server side development. Its implementation is inspired by the user requirements you can find in <a href="https://github.com/MahmoodAhmed-SE/movie-rating-api/blob/main/user-requirements.md">user-requirements</a>. However, I will not follow the requirements strictly.

### Note:
<mark>For learning and testing purposes, free and open license films/videos will be used.</mark>
