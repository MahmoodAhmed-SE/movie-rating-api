# Movie Rating API

## Descritpion
This project is made for the purpose of learning and practicing **Go language** and the backend. Its implementation is inspired by the user requirements you can find in <a href='https://github.com/MahmoodAhmed-SE/movie-rating-api-go/user-requirements.md'>user-requirements</a>. However, I will not follow the requirements strictly.
